If your iPhone screen won't turn on, but you know it's on because you can hear sounds and/or feel it vibrate, don't panic. Try a hard reset! Here's how:

> Press and hold both the **Sleep/Wake** and **Home** buttons for at least 10 seconds, until you see the Apple logo.

_(This works on any iOS device and also when your iOS device is just simply stuck, locked up, or frozen)_
