I've recently stumbled upon an awesome tool, [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). It's an easy to learn formatting syntax for plain text files and also a tool that converts this syntax to HTML.

I use Markdown for generating pretty, organized README files for code repositories and also writing blog posts like this very one! Using Markdown, I'm able to keep the blog content and actual HTML code separate right up until I am ready to post. This allows me to focus on one aspect of a post at a time and avoid getting distracted from the task at hand.

Anyways, I ended up creating a little quick reference and a demo on basic Markdown syntax during my own learning process that I'd like to share, so check it out below!
