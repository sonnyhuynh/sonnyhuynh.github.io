Today, I'm relaunching my blog, this time powered by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)!

Cool thing is you can `git clone` [my entire site](https://github.com/sonnyhuynh/sonnyhuynh.github.io) and have a local copy for yourself! _Not sure why you would do this, but the point is that you can!_

_**Side note:** Apologies for using the default Jekyll site design, I just wanted to get the blog back up and running first before I make it pretty._
