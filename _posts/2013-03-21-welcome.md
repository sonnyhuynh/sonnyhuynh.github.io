Welcome to my software development blog + personal rambling space!

I'll be primarily posting my coding notes that I hope will be useful to someone other than me. Occasionally, I may ramble about something else.

The most useful coding notes will also be synced with my [public Evernote notebook](https://www.evernote.com/pub/sonnyhuynh/public)

Got something to say? Send me a message [@sonny_huynh](https://www.twitter.com/sonny_huynh)
