On my Mac, I don't like to have things on when they are not in use. At the start of my workday, I turn on Bluetooth to use my mouse and keyboard and turn off Wi-Fi since I use a wired connection at my desk. I then switch them back at the end of the workday.

Moving my mouse and making these clicks becomes mildly annoying, so I wrote two [Alfred 2](http://www.alfredapp.com) workflows so that you can toggle Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on/off efficiently.

Enjoy!
