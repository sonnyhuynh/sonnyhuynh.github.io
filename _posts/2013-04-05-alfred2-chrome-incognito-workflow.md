[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com) is a supercharged version of Spotlight. I highly recommend it, as it has saved me many tedious mouse clicks, and has become indispensable in my everyday productivity.

Anyways, Alfred 2 was recently released, so I decided to upgrade to check out its newly added Workflow feature.

One of my most handy Alfred 1.x extensions was [drezha's Launch Chrome Incognito](https://github.com/drezha/Alfred.App_Extensions/tree/master/Launch%20Chrome%20Incognito).

I converted this extension to a workflow, since extensions are not supported in Alfred 2, so get it now!
