This a rant/story about my decision making process that led to the purchase an awesome all-purpose IDE: JetBrains' [IntelliJ IDEA].

### The Dilemma

For my Python Django development, I have been using [PyCharm]. I absolutely love the IDE, so I decided to try out [WebStorm] for the web design foundation of this site. Once I started integration of the design with WordPress, I needed PHP support, so I went on and tried [PhpStorm]. It's just as awesome as the other IDEs.

After all the trial periods expired, the dilemma was created: Pay for the full version or find new free software.

If I buy all three, it would cost me: $99 (PyCharm) + $49 (WebStorm) + $99 (PhpStorm) = **$247**

Too much for me. Maybe I could save somehow? Do I really need all of these? Actually I don't. I don't need WebStorm, since PhpStorm is basically WebStorm + PHP.

Cool. That brought it down to: $99 (PyCharm) + $99 (PhpStorm) = **$198**

Still a lot though of money, and difficult to justify. PASS...

### The Discovery

Along came a tweet by [@jetbrains]:

>Need more reasons to buy great tools from JetBrains? April 15-22, Get up to 50% OFF and support [#EarthDay]! [http://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2013/04/1...]

Sweet! 40% off PyCharm and PhpStorm with this deal: $99 (PyCharm) + $99 (PhpStorm) * 40% OFF = **$118**

Then, I realized I will also have to annually renew the products at $59 / each to keep up to date... So over 2 years, I will be paying: $118 (PyCharm + PhpStorm + 40% OFF) + $59 (PyCharm Renewal) + $59 (PhpStorm Renewal) = **$236**

Again still seems like alot, however, I noticed that this thing called IntelliJ IDEA was marked 50% OFF. Well, what is IntelliJ IDEA? And for 50% off? Kind of hard to pass up what seems like a great deal.

I looked into this and discovered it's a Java IDE and costs $199 non-discounted with $99 renewals. Boo. It seems rather expensive for something I could get for free by sticking with Eclipse and NetBeans... So why is that?

More clicking and I discovered, it also supports Python + PHP via plugins that are kept up to date alongside their standalone IDEs. It also has the same slick UI and [smart code completion] that PyCharm, WebStorm, and PhpStorm all have! (Actually, there's much more to IntelliJ IDEA, the things I have mentioned are just things that would be useful for me.)

### The Decision

So if I were to make this switch, I wouldn't need PyCharm, WebStorm, or PhpStorm. Oh yeah, also goodbye Eclipse and NetBeans. One new software to replace a handful of my current ones. That's simplicity right there. So far so good...

Now with 50% off, over 2 years: $99 (IntelliJ IDEA) + $99 (Renewal) = **$198**

Obviously, this beat the pants off all previous prices, so it's something I just can't and won't pass on.

Now I'm a happy and proud owner of [IntelliJ IDEA]! Thanks [@jetbrains] for making your product so awesome (and for the great deal)!
